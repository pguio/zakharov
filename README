Introduction
============
This package is a solver for the zakharov equation in one-dimension and for
periodic solutions as described in Payne (1983).

The directory matlab contains a Matlab version of the solver. The names
containing the expression _inf is for an infinite domain (use of sech
instead of the Jacobi elliptic function dn).
The directory payne_1983 contains functions to create the figures and
tables of Payne, 1983. In order to create the tables and the figures run
'testall' from Matlab. Thereafter compile the file payne_1983.tex with
latex to generate a document with tables and figures included.
