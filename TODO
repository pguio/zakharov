Things it might be nice to do someday.  I haven't evaluated all of
these suggestions... their presence here doesn't imply my endorsement.

* Add a term to account Joule heating nonlinearity in the slow density 
  fluctuation equation (see Stenflo and Shukla, Parametric instabilities and
	nucleation of coupled Langmuir and acoustic waves in a weakly-ionized
	plasma, Astrophysics and Space Science, 172, 317-320, 1990)


* Add a term to account electron temperature gradient in the fast electric
  field equation (see Kofman et al., Heat flow effect on the plasma line
	frequency, J. Geophys. Res., 98, 6079-6085, 1993)
